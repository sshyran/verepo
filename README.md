veRepo - SASS Library

======

## About

veRepo is a SASS library of modules and mixins for robust and maintainable front-end development using SASS.

## SCSS to SASS

For the SASS syntax lovers or the SCSS syntax haters, you can use `sass-convert` to convert the scss files to sass. Later on I might write a script to automate it but currently it doesn't seem wise to develop a tool which will most probably be rewriten again due to this repository's current state (alpha phase).
